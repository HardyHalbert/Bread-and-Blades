                <p>"I recently tried BnB's for the first time and I was blown away by how delicious their pastries were! The chocolate chips were perfectly gooey and the cookie itself was soft and chewy. I can't wait to order more. Though I should hide the fact that they sell blades as well... my husband would drain our card"</p>

                <p>"BnB's are hands down have the best Blades I've ever seen!. I'm a big fan of the Halberd, bought 10 of 'em buggers!, it's the perfect spearhead for me, I can utilize it to thrust my hardest against my foes. They always arrive clean and sharp, too."</p>

                <p>"I've tried a lot of different pastry shops, but BnB is the one that stands out the most to me. The quality is always top-notch, and they have such a wide variety of flavors to choose from. The Pastry are the perfect treat for any occasion. Also, I think these are the same guys that sold Bandit that damned Halberd!"</p>

                <p>"I stopped by BnB and was blown away by their selection and quality of Blades. The staff were also incredibly knowledgeable and helpful in finding the perfect blade for me. I'm thrilled with my purchase and can't wait to show it off to my brother Bandit!"</p>

                  <h3><em>- Frisky </em></h3>
                  <p>" never thought I'd find a place that combines my two favorite things: carbs and weapons. But Bread and Blades has done just that! Their croissants are so flaky, they could probably deflect a sword, and their baguettes are so crusty, they could double as a mace. And don't even get me started on their selection of knives and swords. If you want to feel like a medieval warrior while enjoying a delicious pastry, Bread and Blades is the spot for you. Just be careful not to accidentally butter your blade and confuse your enemies for your breakfast"</p>

                  <p>"I never thought I would say this, but Bread and Blades is my go-to place for both delicious pastries and deadly weapons - their croissants are flakier than my ex-girlfriend and their knives are sharper than my wit, and that's saying something."</p>

                  <p>"I'm not sure what I love more about Bread and Blades - their perfectly baked bread that melts in your mouth like butter, or their blades that slice through enemies like butter - either way, they've got me covered for both breakfast and battle."</p>

                  <p>"I used to think it was strange to combine a bakery and a weapon shop, but Bread and Blades has proven me wrong - their baguettes are so crusty they could knock someone out, and their swords are so sharp you could probably use them to slice through their baguettes."</p>
